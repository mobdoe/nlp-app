# nlp-app
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) App (streamlit x colab) that generates wordclouds, extracts entities and summarizes text using NLTK WordFrequency Algorithm, TextRank, or BERT.

Considering that we are in the "Information Age", we are constantly bombarded with so much information. Automatic text summarization methods are a growing necessity as people want to be able to discover and consume information faster. It reduces one's reading time and has been used in all industries from news reporting to medicine.

To use, access the notebook via CoLab and run the cells in the order specified.

App Uses:

WORDCLOUDS: A WordCloud is "an image composed of words used in a particular text or subject, in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.‚Äù So, the more often a specific word appears in your text, the bigger and bolder it appears in your word cloud.

ENTITY EXTRACTION: This helps you easily identify the key elements in a text, like names of people, places, organizations, and more. Extracting the main entities in a text helps sort unstructured data and detect important information, which is crucial if you have to deal with long-form text.

TEXT SUMMARIZATION: This app produces extractive summaries and you can choose from 3 methods: NLTK WordFrequency Algorithm, TextRank, or BERT.
